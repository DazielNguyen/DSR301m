In this project, you will apply the knowledge and skills gained throughout the course to analyse weather data collected at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York.

You will demonstrate your data analysis and R programming skills by completing the following tasks:
• Acquire and explore climatological datasets.
• Process, clean, and prepare data using R in Watson Studio.
• Perform statistical and analytical techniques to understand precipitation trends and related weather variables.
Imagine yourself as a Data Scientist at a US Weather Forecast firm. The company is exploring how different climatological variables —such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, dew point, and pressure —impact precipitation patterns.
Your responsibility is to provide a high-level analysis of weather data from JFK Airport. Your stakeholders want to understand both the current and historical records of precipitation and how they relate to different weather conditions.
Few ataset Used in this Assignment
"Tou have been provided with datasets from the NOAA weather station at JFK Airport. The original dataset contains 114,546 hourly observations of 12 local climatological variables (such as temperature and wind speed) collected at JFK airport. This dataset can be obtained for free from the kaggle.
Your submission will be auto-graded by Al using a tool called MARK.
Instructions
First, carefully read through the instructions and the exercises provided in the Jupyter Notebook titled: Lab for Final Project - Analyze NOAA Weather for JFK Airport
You are expected to apply your knowledge of data acquisition, cleaning, visualization, modeling, and evaluation to complete this assignment.
• Ensure that you have downloaded your Jupyter Notebook before beginning the assignment, as you will need to upload it in Question 1.
• When ready, select "Begin" to begin the assignment.
• The final project consists of 1 question: uploading your Jupyter Notebook.
Once you have uploaded the notebook, select "Submit assignment" to complete your submission.
Finally, review the feedback thoroughly.
